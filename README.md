LinkedIn Post Generator

This project helps LinkedIn influencers create fresh posts that match their own writing style. By analyzing their past content, the tool learns their tone, style, and common topics, and then generates new posts that feel authentic and consistent.

Example Use Case

Suppose Mohan is a LinkedIn influencer who regularly shares content. Instead of struggling to draft new posts from scratch, Mohan can upload his previous posts into this tool. The system will:

Identify topics, tone, and structure from past posts

Let Mohan choose a topic, preferred length, and language

Generate new posts that align with his established style

<img src="resources/architecture.jpg"/>

Stage 1: Analyze Past Posts

Extract key attributes such as topic, language, and length from the influencer‚Äôs past LinkedIn posts.

Stage 2: Generate New Posts

Based on the chosen topic, language, and length, the system uses a few-shot learning approach with relevant past posts to guide the LLM.

The generated post matches the influencer‚Äôs writing style.
